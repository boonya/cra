# React App Template

## Development

Before you run the application on your machine, you have to create `.env` file and fill it out with actual secrets.
Also do not forget to run `nvm use` command to apply appropriate `node` and `npm` versions and then install dependencies by `npm i`.

```sh
cp .env.example .env
nvm use
npm i
npm start
```
